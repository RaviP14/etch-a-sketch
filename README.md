Etch-a-sketch Project

In this project I used JS, CSS and HTML.

<ul>
    <li>I improved my knowledge of DOM and its Manipulation.</li>
    <li>I deepened my understanding and usage of CSS Grid.</li>
    <li>I added variable color options for sketching with the default set to one of these.</li>
    <li>The grid can change size up to 100 x 100 "pixels".</li>
</ul>

The Live preview is available <a href="https://ravip14.github.io/etch-a-sketch/">here.</a>
