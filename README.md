Etch-a-sketch Project

In this project I used JS, CSS and HTML.

I improved my knowledge of DOM and its Manipulation.
I deepened my understanding and usage of CSS Grid.
I added variable color options for sketching with the default set to one of these.
The grid can change size up to 100 x 100 "pixels".
